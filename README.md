## Dataset

>  Ford GoBike System Data: This data set contains information about individual rides made in Ford GoBike, a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area, for the month of Feburary in the year 2019. I manipulated the dataset to get the age feature, I also extracted the date of the month of feburary from the datetime, I went ahead to drop all null values before proceeding with the analysis



## Summary of Findings

> During the univariate exploration of the main feature of interest, duration_sec, I looked at the distribution on a logarithmic scale, and I found it to be unimodal.I also found that there were three categories of the member_gender feature. The user_type also had two categories, customer and subscribers. All the categories however where unequally distributed. On all the days of the month of feburary, rides were taken. When I moved on to the bivariate exploration, I noticed that the female category of member_gender and the customer category of the user_type were relatively younger compared to the other categories. Dring the final expolartion, that is the multivariate, I found out that the female customers took longer rides and that only the subscribers shared rides and the subscribers that shared rides had the lowest duration_sec

## Key Insights for Presentation

> For my presentation, I will show the distribution of duration_sec, member_gender, date and User_type features. I will also how the duration_sec was distributed for member_gender and user_type respectively and the which share of member_gender are customers or subscribers. Finally, I will show the multivariate relationship between duration_sec, member_gender and user_type and duration_sec, member_gender and bike_share_for_all_trip to understand how duration of ride was affected based on the different features
